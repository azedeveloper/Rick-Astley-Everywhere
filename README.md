# Rick Astley Everywhere
This is a stupid chrome extension which replaces every image with Rick Astley. I made it in like 30 minutes so it probably has alot of bugs but yeah enjoy ig ðŸ’€


## How to run
- Download the repo as a zip and extract it.
- Go to "chrome://extensions" and turn on Developer Mode.
- Click Load Unpacked and navigate to the folder, select it.

Now the extension should be running
